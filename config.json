This is not the case. For example, when the opposing chain is Polygon, reorgs happen very frequently (and with high reorg depth, below we can see a 44 depth):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1396\" alt=\"Block forks on Polygon\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/342638/129652615-b7b8d4ff-73cd-44e2-b07f-c4077bc67b69.png\">\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**\r\n\r\nEnsure that code that writes to the opposing chain is aware of the difference between a transaction that has been confirmed and one that can be considered finalized.\r\n\r\nRegarding how many confirmations to wait before a block should be considered finalized, it's best to err on the side of caution. We recommend finding out what other bridge platforms or centralized exchanges that work with each of the opposing chains do.\r\n\r\nThe [Matic/Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/login) will wait for up to 8 minutes before minting a transfer from Ethereum mainnet to Polygon chain - given that the average block time on Polygon is around [2.5 seconds](https://polygonscan.com/chart/blocktime) this would mean waiting for a **minimum of 192 blocks depth** before considering a transaction in it as finalized.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"580\" alt=\"Polygon Bridge: Ethereum to Polygon transfer times\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/342638/129828771-9ea10b8c-367f-4c80-9c0c-82967df10042.png\">\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n* [Polygon Blocks Forked](https://polygonscan.com/blocks_forked) \r\n* [Reorgs and Other Blockchain Quirkiness: Polyroll Update v2.01](https://polyroll.medium.com/reorgs-and-other-blockchain-quirkiness-polyroll-game-update-v2-01-63c12e6829ac)\r\n* [Matic/Polygon Bridge](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)\r\n* [Polygon Block Time Chart](https://polygonscan.com/chart/blocktime)",

            "body": "**Description**\r\n\r\nThe HaloDAO bridge uses the [HAL](https://www.hal.xyz/) service in order to initiate a token transfer from the source chain to a destination chain.\r\n\r\nWhen the source chain is Ethereum mainnet, the Halo team informed us that the HAL service uses 3 block confirmations before it fires a notification to the Halo Bridge webhook handler.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that 3 confirmations are not nearly enough to consider a block as final. It was trivial to find a block with a [Re-Org depth of 3 blocks](https://etherscan.io/block/12784345/f) within the last 2 months.\r\n\r\nGranted, the Ethereum PoW blockchain only gives [Probabilistic Finality](https://medium.com/mechanism-labs/finality-in-blockchain-consensus-d1f83c120a9a) - the probability that a transaction will not be reverted increases as the block which contains that transaction sinks deeper into the chain. Therefore we want to aim for a much higher block confirmation number than what HAL service currently has.\r\n\r\nThe more general issue is that the HAL service, with its current settings, is targeted more towards end-user and non-critical types of applications, where an extra event fired for a block that does not end up in the main chain, can be handled gracefully/ignored. In the case of a cross-chain bridge, this type of issue can cause a double-spend transaction with the consequence of **loss of funds of its users**.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation**\r\n\r\nA cross-chain bridge, within the context of block finality, is not different than a centralized exchange: security needs to be paramount.\r\n\r\nTherefore block finality should be increased to match what other reputable exchanges use for ERC20 token deposits:\r\n\r\n| Coinbase | Kraken | Binance | FTX |\r\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| [35](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/cryptocurrency-trading-pairs/uni) | [20](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/203325283-Cryptocurrency-deposit-processing-times) | [12](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/360030775291) | [10](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034865571-Blockchain-Deposits-and-Withdrawals)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we recommend having a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with a service provider like HAL, that clearly outlines the availability and quality of the service provided. As an example, separate infrastructure from the end-user HAL infrastructure might mean that HALO Bridge is not affected when HAL experiences load from their free / end-user accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n* [Finality in Blockchain Consensus](https://medium.com/mechanism-labs/finality-in-blockchain-consensus-d1f83c120a9a)\r\n* [Re-Org depth of 3 blocks](https://etherscan.io/block/12784345/f)\r\n* [Kraken Cryptocurrency deposit processing times](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/203325283-Cryptocurrency-deposit-processing-times)\r\n* [Coinbase Uniswap deposit processing times](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/cryptocurrency-trading-pairs/uni)\r\n* [Binance Reduces the Number of Confirmations Required for Deposits & Withdrawals on BTC and ETH Networks](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/360030775291)\r\n* [FTX Blockchain Deposits and Withdrawals](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034865571-Blockchain-Deposits-and-Withdrawals)",
